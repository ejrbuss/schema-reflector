## Example database

- We will use the MySQL example database "shakila" and model it using EE JPA for this module.
- The sakila sample database is designed to represent a DVD rental store.
- See http://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/

## About java-ee6-examples

Explore Java EE 6 by examples
    You will find Maven based projects that explore some of major EE 6
    components or specs with working code examples. Most of the examples
    are tested on Glassfish Server 3.

    The purpose of this project is just for my own learning and exploration.
    You may use these as tutorial and further explore the EE stack yourself.

# Dependencies
These sample applications try not to use any external dependencies jars other
than the EE API provided by application server. However on some modules
examples, you do need to install MySQL driver jar into your application server
and setup DataSource in order to work. See the individual module example's README
file for details.

# Modifications

The source code for this example has been modified to
demonstrate Schema Reflector's ability to find implicit
foreign keys from jpa in source code.
